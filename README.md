# Bloom_Filter-customizable-
This project implements a Bloom Filter, a probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. The Bloom Filter can produce false positives (incorrectly identifying an element as part of the set), but it will never produce false negatives (failing to identify an element that is in the set).
